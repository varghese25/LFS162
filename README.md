## Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- **Jenkins** – Open source automation server for building, testing, and deploying code.
- **Travis CI** – CI/CD service integrated with GitHub for automated testing and deployment.
- **CircleCI** – Cloud-based CI/CD platform supporting automation and parallel testing.

## Configuration Management
- **Ansible** – Open source automation tool for configuration management, deployment, and task automation.
- **Chef** – Infrastructure automation using reusable scripts called recipes.
- **Puppet** – Automates provisioning and management of infrastructure.

## Containerization and Orchestration
